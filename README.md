# CCE
Cloud Correlation Engine (under construction...)

CCE is a Cloud-based SIEM Correlation Engine that processes and correlates events using a stateless FaaS model while retaining the architecture of traditional SIEMs. CCEâ€™s design comprises three main stages:
Modeling - Transforming the stateful SIEM correlation engine into a stateless design for serverless functions. 
Automation - Translating textual rules into executable serverless functions. 
Optimization - Optimizing function grouping, execution, and hardware configuration for cost-efficiency.
CCE is the first cloud-based SIEM correlation engine capable of generating code for filter and correlation rules, deploying them as FaaS; processing events and generating alerts; and correlating alerts over time to produce alarms.
